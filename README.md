project is fully open source, and you can use the code for any purpose (it will be nice if you credit 8AAFFF tho)

To run the build:

1. Find and download build file for your system in [game_builds](https://github.com/marmust/internet-scanner/tree/main/Unity_stuff/game_builds) folder. 
2. Unzip downloaded file to new folder
3. Run `graph renderer.exe`
3. You may get an error saying "Windows Protected Your PC". This is normal, click the `more options` link, then click the `Run Anyway` button.

The build is only for windows however, you're out of luck if you run any other OS.

To open the Unity Project:
1. Make sure Unity is installed properly on your system.
2. Download the `graph renderer unity project` directory from the parent directory: [Unity_stuff](https://github.com/marmust/internet-scanner/tree/main/Unity_stuff)
3. Open the Unity Launcher.
4. Select: "Import and existing project" (The wording might have changed since the last time I used Unity 5+ years ago, but it should be similar).
5. Navigate to where you put your `graph renderer unity project` directory and select it. (GitHub will download the folder as a `.zip` so you'll have to unzip it first.
6. Have fun!
